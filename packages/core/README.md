ðŸ“¦ Functional approach to compose your webpack config.

This is the core library.


## Exported functions

#### createConfig(configSetter: Function[]): object

Takes an array of config setters (the functions returned by invoked webpack blocks), invokes them and returns the resulting webpack config object.

#### env(envName: string, configSetters: Function[]): Function

Applies an array of webpack blocks only if `process.env.NODE_ENV` matches the given `envName`. If no `NODE_ENV` is set, it will be treated as 'development'.
